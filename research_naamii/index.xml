      <title>Insulin Resistance in Diabetes</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigating-type-2-diabetes-associated-gut-microbiome-diversity-in-nepalese-populationbr&#34;&gt;Investigating Type-2 Diabetes Associated Gut Microbiome Diversity in Nepalese Population&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type-2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged as a global health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Nepal bears a substantial T2D burden and it is a prominent cause of mortality in adults. Increasing urbanization and changing lifestyles have directly contributed to a surge in T2D cases in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T2D is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from insufficient insulin production to effectively regulate glucose utilization in the body. It is a complex disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors, notably diet and physical activity. Consuming excessive amounts of refined sugars and processed foods increases the risk of developing T2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography and diet play a substantial role in shaping gut microbiome, which, in turn, is associated with T2D progression. While many investigations have focused on diabetic populations in Western nations, the gut microbiome of South Asian populations diverges notably from that of Western populations, largely due to differences in dietary composition. To comprehensively identify T2D-associated gut microbiomes, we propose investigating the diversity of gut microbiomes among the T2D population in Nepal, alongside leveraging publicly available T2D gut microbiome cohorts from different countries. Our study will help develop preventive and treatment strategies tailored to specific populations, mitigating health disparities in diabetes research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HPV-mediated Cancers</title>
      <link>/research_naamii/hpv_cancer_genomics/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;biomarkers-of-hpv-negative-head-and-neck-cancer-br&#34;&gt;Biomarkers of HPV-negative head and neck cancer &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10% of worldwide cancer cases are linked to viruses. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is specifically associated with both cervical cancer and Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), often sexually transmitted. In Nepal, cervical cancer stands out as one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women, while HNC ranks as a significant contributor to cancer morbidity in both sexes. HPV infection is identified in nearly all cervical cases. In contrast, about 70% of HNC cases exhibit HPV infections, with the remaining 30% linked to factors such as smoking and alcohol/tobacco consumption, rendering them HPV-negative. The presence or absence of HPV infection in HNC is closely tied to disease prognosis and significantly influences treatment approaches. In cervical cancer and HNC, the virus integrates into the host genome, activating E6/E7 oncoproteins that dysregulate cell-cycle regulation and promote uncontrolled cell proliferation. The risk of HPV-mediated cancers is significantly lowered through HPV vaccination, contributing to a global decrease in its incidence. HPV vaccination campaign globally decreases the prevalence of HPV-positive HNC, leading to a potential increase in HPV-negative HNC in the future. HPV-negative HNC cancers are genetically different than HPV-mediated cancers, often presenting as more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and less responsive to standard-of-care treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to discern the genomic predictors of HPV-negative cancers that can aid in early detection and disease prognosis prediction. In this study, we will identify genomic predictors of HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers using machine learning models trained in multi-omics data from both cervical cancer and HNC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting drug-resistant Tuberculosis</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;systems-genomics-modelling-of-drug-resistance-in-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-br&#34;&gt;Systems Genomics Modelling of Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-drug resistance presents a growing challenge to global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, with a particularly pressing concern in developing nations where robust disease surveillance and monitoring are lacking. Nepal is one of the countries with a high TB burden. TB is caused by an airborne bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb). Treatment for TB involves antibiotics, however, some Mtb becomes resistant to these drugs, forming drug-resistant TB, which is rapidly increasing and poses a major health threat. The emergence of drug resistance TB is linked to specific mutations in Mtb genome. However, the genetic foundations of drug resistance in TB are not fully understood. The existing catalog of well-characterized Mtb drug-resistant mutations falls short in elucidating numerous instances of drug-resistant TB. Identifying new drug-resistant TB mutations is challenging given the genetic diversity of TB and the complex mechanisms driving the drug resistance. To address these challenges, here, we aim to develop a machine learning method to predict drug-resistant TB leveraging a large pool of TB genomic data. Additionally, we will explore the underlying metabolic adaptation in drug-resistant TB using genome-scale metabolic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing efficient dengue vaccine</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mining-dengue-virus-immunopeptidome-for-next-generation-dengue-vaccine-br&#34;&gt;Mining Dengue virus immunopeptidome for next-generation dengue vaccine &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a viral infection caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly female Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. Dengue presents an escalating global public health crisis, endangering nearly half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population at a significantly high level of risk. Preventing severe dengue cases by vaccination is crucial for reducing the overall disease burden, minimizing hospitalizations, and saving lives. Currently, available dengue vaccines are ineffective in providing complete immunity against all serotypes of the virus, and their efficacy varies widely across different age groups and prior dengue exposure statuses. Thus, there is an urgent need for a balanced dengue vaccine effective against all DENV serotypes. For this, we aim to discover new molecular targets essential for the development of a more effective next-generation dengue vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;genomic-epidemiology-of-sars-cov-2-in-nepal&#34;&gt;Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Nepal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly escalated into a global pandemic. Nepal detected its first case in January 2020, and since then, the country has grappled with over a million infections and a significant loss of life. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have diligently studied the virus&amp;rsquo;s genetic composition and its evolving transmission patterns. Various geographic regions have experienced multiple waves of infection, each dominated by a novel virus variant. Notably, some of these emerging strains pose challenges to the effectiveness of existing vaccines. Understanding these variants, their origins, and their spread within communities is crucial for future pandemic preparedness. In Nepal, researchers have made significant progress by sharing thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences publicly. However, comprehensive investigation on these cases has not been conducted till date. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Nepal. We will investigate virus&amp;rsquo;s genetic diversity, evolutionary trajectory, and epidemiological patterns. Our long-term vision is to create bioinformatics pipelines and platforms which could be readily deployed in case of any future epidemics or pandemics which will help us understand the transmission of the infectious disease and enable rapid intervention of the disease. Toward this goal, we have created the “Nepal SARS-CoV-2 Genome Database”, a comprehensive phylogenetic clustering of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Nepal using Nextstrain, a powerful open-source tool for the real-time interactive visualization of genome sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;
