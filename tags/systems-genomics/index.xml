      <title>Insulin Resistance in Diabetes</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigating-type-2-diabetes-associated-gut-microbiome-diversity-in-nepalese-populationbr&#34;&gt;Investigating Type-2 Diabetes Associated Gut Microbiome Diversity in Nepalese Population&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type-2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged as a global health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Nepal bears a substantial T2D burden and it is a prominent cause of mortality in adults. Increasing urbanization and changing lifestyles have directly contributed to a surge in T2D cases in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T2D is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from insufficient insulin production to effectively regulate glucose utilization in the body. It is a complex disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors, notably diet and physical activity. Consuming excessive amounts of refined sugars and processed foods increases the risk of developing T2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography and diet play a substantial role in shaping gut microbiome, which, in turn, is associated with T2D progression. While many investigations have focused on diabetic populations in Western nations, the gut microbiome of South Asian populations diverges notably from that of Western populations, largely due to differences in dietary composition. To comprehensively identify T2D-associated gut microbiomes, we propose investigating the diversity of gut microbiomes among the T2D population in Nepal, alongside leveraging publicly available T2D gut microbiome cohorts from different countries. Our study will help develop preventive and treatment strategies tailored to specific populations, mitigating health disparities in diabetes research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting drug-resistant Tuberculosis</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;systems-genomics-modelling-of-drug-resistance-in-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-br&#34;&gt;Systems Genomics Modelling of Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-drug resistance presents a growing challenge to global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, with a particularly pressing concern in developing nations where robust disease surveillance and monitoring are lacking. Nepal is one of the countries with a high TB burden. TB is caused by an airborne bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; (Mtb). Treatment for TB involves antibiotics, however, some Mtb becomes resistant to these drugs, forming drug-resistant TB, which is rapidly increasing and poses a major health threat. The emergence of drug resistance TB is linked to specific mutations in Mtb genome. However, the genetic foundations of drug resistance in TB are not fully understood. The existing catalog of well-characterized Mtb drug-resistant mutations falls short in elucidating numerous instances of drug-resistant TB. Identifying new drug-resistant TB mutations is challenging given the genetic diversity of TB and the complex mechanisms driving the drug resistance. To address these challenges, here, we aim to develop a machine learning method to predict drug-resistant TB leveraging a large pool of TB genomic data. Additionally, we will explore the underlying metabolic adaptation in drug-resistant TB using genome-scale metabolic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
