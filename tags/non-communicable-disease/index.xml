      <title>Insulin Resistance in Diabetes</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;investigating-type-2-diabetes-associated-gut-microbiome-diversity-in-nepalese-populationbr&#34;&gt;Investigating Type-2 Diabetes Associated Gut Microbiome Diversity in Nepalese Population&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type-2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged as a global health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Nepal bears a substantial T2D burden and it is a prominent cause of mortality in adults. Increasing urbanization and changing lifestyles have directly contributed to a surge in T2D cases in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T2D is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from insufficient insulin production to effectively regulate glucose utilization in the body. It is a complex disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors, notably diet and physical activity. Consuming excessive amounts of refined sugars and processed foods increases the risk of developing T2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography and diet play a substantial role in shaping gut microbiome, which, in turn, is associated with T2D progression. While many investigations have focused on diabetic populations in Western nations, the gut microbiome of South Asian populations diverges notably from that of Western populations, largely due to differences in dietary composition. To comprehensively identify T2D-associated gut microbiomes, we propose investigating the diversity of gut microbiomes among the T2D population in Nepal, alongside leveraging publicly available T2D gut microbiome cohorts from different countries. Our study will help develop preventive and treatment strategies tailored to specific populations, mitigating health disparities in diabetes research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HPV-mediated Cancers</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;biomarkers-of-hpv-negative-head-and-neck-cancer-br&#34;&gt;Biomarkers of HPV-negative head and neck cancer &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10% of worldwide cancer cases are linked to viruses. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is specifically associated with both cervical cancer and Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), often sexually transmitted. In Nepal, cervical cancer stands out as one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women, while HNC ranks as a significant contributor to cancer morbidity in both sexes. HPV infection is identified in nearly all cervical cases. In contrast, about 70% of HNC cases exhibit HPV infections, with the remaining 30% linked to factors such as smoking and alcohol/tobacco consumption, rendering them HPV-negative. The presence or absence of HPV infection in HNC is closely tied to disease prognosis and significantly influences treatment approaches. In cervical cancer and HNC, the virus integrates into the host genome, activating E6/E7 oncoproteins that dysregulate cell-cycle regulation and promote uncontrolled cell proliferation. The risk of HPV-mediated cancers is significantly lowered through HPV vaccination, contributing to a global decrease in its incidence. HPV vaccination campaign globally decreases the prevalence of HPV-positive HNC, leading to a potential increase in HPV-negative HNC in the future. HPV-negative HNC cancers are genetically different than HPV-mediated cancers, often presenting as more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and less responsive to standard-of-care treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to discern the genomic predictors of HPV-negative cancers that can aid in early detection and disease prognosis prediction. In this study, we will identify genomic predictors of HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers using machine learning models trained in multi-omics data from both cervical cancer and HNC.&lt;/p&gt;
